# Network

A Twitter-like social network website where users can create profiles, make posts, follow other users, and like and comment on posts.

For testing web applications, I use Selenium framework .

Run `python manage.py makemigrations network` to make migrations for the network app.

Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations to your database.

Run `python manage.py runserver`

To run tests with Selenium in a Django project Install Selenium `pip install selenium` and Install a WebDriver.

To execute the tests, run `python manage.py test`
