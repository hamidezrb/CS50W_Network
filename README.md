# Network

  A Twitter-like social network website where users can create profiles, make posts, follow other users, and like and comment on posts.
  For testing web applications, I use Selenium framework .
  Run <code>python manage.py makemigrations network</code> to make migrations for the network app.
  Run <code>python manage.py migrate</code> to apply migrations to your database.
  Run <code>python manage.py runserver</code>
